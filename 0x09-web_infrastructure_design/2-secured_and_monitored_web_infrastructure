This is a 3-server web infrastructure that is secured, monitored, and serves encrypted traffic.

Issues With This Infrastructure

    1. Terminating SSL at the load balancer level would leave the traffic between the load balancer and the web
        servers unencrypted.
    2. Having one MySQL server is an issue because it is not scalable and can act as a single point of failure for
        the web infrastructure.
    3. Having servers with all the same components would make the components contend for resources on the server
        like CPU, Memory, I/O, etc., which can lead to poor performance and also make it difficult to locate the
          source of the problem. A setup such as this is not easily scalable.
