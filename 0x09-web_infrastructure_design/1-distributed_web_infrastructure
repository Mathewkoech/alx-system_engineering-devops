Issues With This Infrastructure

    1. There are multiple SPOF (Single Point Of Failure).
        For example, if the Primary MySQL database server is down, the entire site would be unable to make changes
          to the site (including adding or removing users). The server containing the load balancer and the
            application server connecting to the primary database server are also SPOFs.
    2. Security issues.
        The data transmitted over the network isn't encrypted using an SSL certificate so hackers can spy on the
          network. There is no way of blocking unauthorized IPs since there's no firewall installed on any server.
    3. No monitoring.
        We have no way of knowing the status of each server since they're not being monitored.
